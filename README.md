# Automated-Excel-Graphing

The automated excel graphing tool takes in data through excel and converts it to a readable graph. It uses the pandas, matplotlib, and xlwings libraries to modify, plot, and export data onto an existing excel sheet that data is being derived from.  

First, the pandas library is used to read in the excel file, and then convert the necessary columns of data into a pivot table. This pivot table is plotted as a basic horizontal bar graph.  
Then the matplotlib library is used to modify the existing plot into a graph that is presentable.  
Lastly, the xlwings library writes this plot to the excel sheet itself, thus completing the automation of a professional looking graph using sales data.
